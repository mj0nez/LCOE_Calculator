## Requirements:

**DEPENDENCIES**

Development and testing was done with and WinOS:
- **matplotlib** 3.3.4
- **numpy** 1.20.1
- **PyQt5** 5.15.4

A multi platform application may need further adjustments.


----------
## Usage:

**EXECUTION**

Running main.py or gui.py will start the application and open the gui. Now
 users may plot the default values or use their own inputs. A new figure will
  be generated for each plot command. Further buttons allow to close all active
   figures or to directly exit the application.

The application runs until all generated instances (gui and plots) are closed. 
Therefore users should use the 'Exit App' button to close all windows and
 finish the program's runtime.
